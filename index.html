           <h1>about the educators</h1>
           <p>Established in November 1975 as the Les Anges Montessori Academy for toddlers, Beaconhouse has since grown into a global network of private schools, institutes, and universities, imparting distinctive and meaningful education to students from pre-school to post-graduation. The Educators, a project of Beaconhouse, has completed eleven years of service to educational development across the country with remarkable success. Established in 2002, it now has 800+ campuses & the market leader in Pakistan's educational landscape with a presence in over 215+ cities and a student strength exceeding 175,000+. This makes The Educators outreach the largest compared to any other private school in the world.</p>
